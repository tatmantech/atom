class car():

    # init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, model, color): 
        self.model = model
        self.color = color

    def show(self):
        print("Model is", self.model )
        print("color is", self.color )

# both objects have different self which
# contain their attributes
audi = car("audi a4", "blue")
ferrari = car("ferrari 488", "green")

audi.show()     # same output as car.show(audi)
ferrari.show()  # same output as car.show(ferrari)

# Behind the scene, in every instance method
# call, python sends the instances also with
# that method call like car.show(audi)
